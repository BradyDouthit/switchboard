# Switchboard

A lightweight, CLI framework for Go that makes building command-line applications simple and intuitive. I was originally inspired by another tool I was working on that quickly got difficult to reason about due to multiple commands and flags. As such, I took inspiration from Express.js for the nice separation of concerns that their API provides.

## Installation

go get github.com/BradyDouthit/switchboard
